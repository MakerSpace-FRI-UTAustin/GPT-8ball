# GPT-8ball

This is the official repository of the GPT magic 8 ball project at UT Austin Maker Space FRI.

### **Description**

Open AI has recently made their API public to use. While many rush to make a plugin or some software with it, we here want to experiment with its usage in the physical space. 

Using an Internet connected ESP-32 and some other electronics, we can record a voice clip, send it to the API and then generate a chatGPT response.
